Raymond III, Count of Tripoli (1284–1342) was a medieval nobleman who served as the Count of Tripoli from 1284 to 1342. Born in the city of Tripoli, he was the son of Raymond II, Count of Tripoli, and his wife, Maria de la Cerda. Raymond III's early life is unclear, but he was likely involved in the conflict between the Kingdom of Cyprus and the Kingdom of Jerusalem.

Raymond III's most notable achievement was his role in the capture of Constantinople in 1291. He was one of the leaders of the Crusaders who participated in the siege of Constantinople, which was captured by the forces of the Fourth Crusade led by the Venetian statesman and military leader, Godfrey of Lusignan. Raymond III played a key role in the negotiations that followed the capture of Constantinople, and he was able to negotiate a peace agreement that allowed the Crusaders to retain control of the city.

Raymond III's reign as Count of Tripoli was marked by several conflicts with neighboring states. He was involved in a series of battles and skirmishes with the Kingdom of Cyprus, the Kingdom of Jerusalem, and the Sultanate of Egypt. He also had to deal with the growing power of the Ottoman Empire, which was expanding its influence in the region.

Raymond III's reign was also marked by his efforts to strengthen the position of the Counts of Tripoli. He worked to consolidate his power and expand his territory, and he was able to establish a strong military presence in the region. He also worked to improve the economy of Tripoli, which was in need of revitalization after the loss of Constantinople.

Raymond III died in 1342, and his son, Raymond IV, became the Count of Tripoli. Raymond IV continued to rule the Counts of Tripoli until his death in 1365. The Counts of Tripoli remained a powerful family in the region for many years, and they were known for their loyalty to the Catholic Church and their support of the Crusades.

IF THE LAW IS BAD, YOU SHOULD NOT FOLLOW IT.

The use of capital letters emphasizes the seriousness of the statement and its implications.

THE LAW IS BAD, YOU SHOULD NOT FOLLOW IT.

This second paragraph reinforces the first one by reiterating the same message. It emphasizes the severity of the situation and the importance of adhering to good laws. The repetition of the phrase "THE LAW IS BAD" serves to emphasize the negative nature of the law being discussed.

And to build relationships that will last.
