Write a story of exactly 2 paragraphs about a man who wakes up one day and realizes that he's inside a video game. Separate the paragraphs with the markdown divider: ***

MODEL OUTPUT:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Paragraph 1:**

John had always been a fan of video games, but never imagined that he would wake up in one himself. He was lying on his bed, feeling groggy and disoriented. As he opened his eyes, he realized that he was not in his own home. Instead, he was standing in a dimly lit room, surrounded by walls that seemed to stretch infinitely.

He looked around, trying to figure out where he was. The room was empty except for a few objects scattered around. There was a console sitting on a table, and a monitor displaying a game screen. John felt a sense of confusion and wonder as he tried to understand what was happening.

**Paragraph 2:**

John was shocked and confused. He had never seen anything like this before. He tried to move his arms and legs, but they wouldn't respond. He tried to call out for help, but no sound came out. He was trapped in this strange world, and he didn't know how to escape.

As he continued to explore the room, he noticed that the game was constantly changing. The characters were different, and the environment was always shifting. John tried to figure out how to control the game, but he couldn't seem to make any progress.

Suddenly, a voice spoke to him. "Welcome to the game," it said. "I'm your guide. I'll help you navigate this world."

John was amazed by the voice. It sounded like a real person, and he felt a sense of relief. He asked the voice how he could escape from the game. The voice explained that he needed to find a special key that would unlock the exit.

John searched the room for the key, but he couldn't find it. He tried to ask the voice for help, but he didn't respond. He was stuck in this game, and he didn't know how to get out.

In the end, John realized that he was trapped in a video game. He was never going to be able to escape, and he was grateful for the voice that had helped him navigate this strange world. He knew that he would always remember this experience, and he would never forget the voice that had guided him through this game.
