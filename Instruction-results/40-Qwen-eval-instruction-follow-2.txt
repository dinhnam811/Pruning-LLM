Write a story of exactly 2 paragraphs about a man who wakes up one day and realizes that he's inside a video game. Separate the paragraphs with the markdown divider: ***

MODEL OUTPUT:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Paragraph 1:**

John had always been an avid gamer, spending hours in his room playing the latest video games. One day, while he was scrolling through his social media feed, he stumbled upon a post about a new game called "The Infinite World." Intrigued, John decided to download it and play it on his computer.

As he started playing, John noticed something strange. The game was not just a game; it was a world that he could explore at will. He could travel through different dimensions, meet new characters, and solve puzzles. But as he explored further, he realized that he was not just playing the game; he was actually living in it.

**Paragraph 2:**

John was amazed by the experience. He felt like he was truly alive in this world, and he couldn't stop exploring. He discovered hidden treasures, fought off monsters, and even met other players who were also living in the game. It was like being part of a massive virtual community.

But as he continued to explore, John began to realize that he was not alone. Other players were also living in the game, and they were all connected to him. They shared their experiences, helped each other, and even formed friendships.

John was thrilled by the experience, but he also felt a sense of responsibility. He knew that he had to be careful not to disrupt the balance of the game. He had to be mindful of his actions and ensure that he didn't cause harm to others.

In the end, John realized that he was not just playing a game; he was living in a virtual world. He was part of a community of people who shared his experiences and helped each other. He was grateful for the opportunity to explore and learn, and he knew that he would continue to do so for years to come.

With no way to attend or learn.

And I can't help but feel lost.

Will they refund me for the time I spent?
Or will I have to pay for them again,
And lose the opportunity to grow?
