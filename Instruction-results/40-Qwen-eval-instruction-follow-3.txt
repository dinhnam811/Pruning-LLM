Born in the city of Tripoli, he was the son of Raymond II, Count of Tripoli, and his wife, Maria de la Cerda. Raymond III inherited his title from his father and became one of the most powerful and influential figures in the Mediterranean region during the late 13th century.

### Early Life and Career

He was married twice, first to Maria de la Cerda and then to Isabella de la Cerda, who was the daughter of his first wife. His marriage to Isabella de la Cerda led to the birth of his son, Raymond IV, Count of Tripoli.

### The War of the Sicilian Vespers

Raymond III's career was marked by his involvement in the War of the Sicilian Vespers, which was a series of conflicts between the Kingdom of Naples and the Kingdom of Sicily. The war began in 1305 and lasted until 1309, with Raymond III serving as the leader of the Kingdom of Naples. During this period, he fought against the forces of the King of Sicily, Alfonso III of Aragon, and his brother, Henry III of Castile.

### The Fall of Tripoli

In 1336, Raymond III was captured by the forces of the King of Sicily, Alfonso III of Aragon. He was taken to Palermo, where he was held captive for several years. During his captivity, he was able to negotiate a peace agreement with the King of Sicily, which allowed him to retain his title as Count of Tripoli.

### Legacy

Raymond III's legacy is primarily associated with his role in the War of the Sicilian Vespers and his efforts to maintain his power and influence in the Mediterranean region. His capture and subsequent captivity had a significant impact on his career and reputation, and he was seen as a symbol of the struggle between the Kingdoms of Naples and Sicily.

### Conclusion

Raymond III, Count of Tripoli, was a powerful and influential figure in the Mediterranean region during the late 13th century. His involvement in the War of the Sicilian Vespers and his efforts to maintain his power and influence have left a lasting legacy in the history of the region. His story continues to be studied by historians and scholars, who continue to explore the complex political and social dynamics of the time.
